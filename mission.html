                <p>Our mission at OverPowered HQ is to create a fun community where people play to have fun, not just for the sake of grinding. There are many ways we accomplish this, scroll down to find out more!</p>

                    <h1>No Requirement</h1>
                    <p>At OverPowered, we have no requirement for joining. This means even if you just started playing yesterday, you can join as long as you have a username! The reason for this is that we don't want to limit our guild to only the people with a Super, or level 100 because that defeats the purpose of our guild. We are trying to have fun, not to play for the sake of playing.</p>
