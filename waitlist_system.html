            <h1 class="align_center">The OverPowered Waitlist System</h1>
            <p class="align_center">
                Due to OverPowered receiving many applications to join, we at OvPo HQ have taken inspiration up with a system that is used widely in Florr guilds and adapted it to work for OverPowered! Here's how it works:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Step 1: Joining the Discord server. This is to make sure we can contact you outside of Florr.</li>
                <li>Step 2: Let an admin know to add you to the waitlsit. We'll take care of it from there.</li>
                <li>Step 3: Waiting! Unfortunately, it is called a "wait" list so... This wait list works on a first come first serve basis. If you applied after someone else, you will get invited after them.</li>
                <li>Step 4: Once a slot opens up, we will DM you or ping you in our guild Discord server. If you do not respond within 48 hours, we'll contact the next person, but we'll keep you at the top of the waitlist until you come back!</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="align_center">
                Note: Slots can open up in 2 ways. The first one is a person leaves. However, if someone has been at the top of the waitlist for 2 days, we'll check if anyone has been inactive for a long time and kick them to make room. Since this system is prone to error, and can be unfair, any person who has been kicked instead of leaving voluntarily will automatically be put at the top of the waitlist!
