                <h1>Humble beginnings - February 2024</h1>
                <p>P2AH, the founder of OvPo initially created the guild to play with a friend group in real life. This was back in the time of the World Map, with Centralia and everything. P2AH had a couple Ultras, but Supers were still incredibly rare. However, P2AH was still considered pretty high level at the time, and was able to carry his friends to get some Mythics.</p>

                <h1>The Carry Guild - January 2025</h1>
                <p>Eventually, P2AH's real life friend group stopped playing Florr and moved on to other games. He decided to turn the guild into a carry guild and started inviting random people in game. Initially, this was just a casual thing that only applied to people in-game.</p>

                <h1>Advertising - March 2025</h1>
                <p>When Florrcord's #squads-guilds channel initially came out, P2AH took full advantage of it and began advertising the guild as a no in game reqirement guild. The only requirement was to "be active". This marked the beginning of OvPo's growth, as many new people began to join and a lot of the people invited in-game began to leave.</p>

                <h1>New Mission - August 2025</h1>
                <p>Around halfway through 2025, OvPo's average level began to rise dramatically. There was a common trend where people would leave once they got their first Super. On top of that, P2AH started to have less time to manage the guild. This led to a change in OverPowered's mission: Instead of being a carry guild, our mission was to have fun while playing the game instead of playing for the sake of grinding.</p>

                <h1>Leadership Change - February 2026</h1>
                <p>Starting the new year, P2AH was very busy and had no time to manage the guild. Eventually, he also realized that in the future, he would not be able to manage the guild either. This, and a few other reasons, led to him deciding to retire as guild leader. The new guild leader would be stormlet!</p>
